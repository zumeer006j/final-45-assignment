//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

import { features } from "process";

function storecarinfor(manufacturer:string, modelname:string,...extraoption: {[key:string]:any}[]): void {

    
    const carinfor={
        manufacturer,
        modelname,
        ...Object.assign({},extraoption)
    }
    console.log(carinfor);
     

    };
    
let answer = storecarinfor('honda','civic',{color:'red'},{features:["Navigation","power window"]})

console.log(answer);
